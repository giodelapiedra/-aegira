## Problem Section

```
Title: "You're Missing the Full Picture"

Your current systems:
✗ HR tracks who showed up — not how they're doing
✗ Incidents are reported after the fact — not prevented
✗ Return-to-work is paperwork — not tracked properly

The gaps cost you:
• Preventable incidents
• Extended recovery times
• WorkSafe compliance issues
• Lost productivity

### 2. RESPOND — Incident & WHS Management

## Why All-in-One Matters

```
Title: "Connected Data. Complete Visibility."

The Problem with Separate Systems:
• Health data here, incidents there, rehab somewhere else
• No connection between prevention and response
• Can't see patterns across the cycle
• Compliance gaps

With Aegira:
• One worker profile, complete history
• Prevention data linked to incidents
• Recovery tracked back to original event
• Full audit trail, always compliant

## FAQ Section

```
Q: Is this an attendance system?
A: No. We don't track attendance — your HR system does that.
   Aegira tracks health and wellness, which HR systems don't do.

Q: Is the daily check-in mandatory?
A: That's up to you. We recommend voluntary participation
   because honest data is more valuable than forced compliance.

Q: How long does the daily check-in take?
A: 30 seconds. Four quick ratings: mood, stress, sleep, physical health.

Q: Does this integrate with our existing HR system?
A: Aegira works alongside your HR system, not replacing it.
   API integrations available on Growth and Enterprise plans.

Q: Where is data hosted?
A: Australia (AWS Sydney) for Australian customers.
   Your data stays in Australia.

Q: Is this compliant with WorkSafe requirements?
A: Yes. Aegira helps you demonstrate due diligence in managing
   worker health and safety, with audit-ready documentation.

Q: What if workers don't check in?
A: You still get value from those who do. Our AI provides insights
   based on available data. More participation = better insights.

Q: Can WHS officers manage incidents?
A: Yes. WHS role includes incident assignment, investigation tracking,
   physio assignment, and RTW certificate management.
